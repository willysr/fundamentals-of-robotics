00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.940
Here, an example of two experiments with a
wheeled robot: on the left one with more precise

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.140
encoders than the one on the right.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.260
In green the ground truth, in red the estimate
from the wheel odometry.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.560
The errors in the odometry result in the estimate
being out of bound of the map, as time passes.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.170
Note the error can come from several factors,
including inaccurate encoders, slipping wheels,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.140
and different friction.
