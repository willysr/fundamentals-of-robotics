00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's do now a simple exercise on the discrete
time controller.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.590
We need to have all the information
that we have seen for a feedback controller.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.440
In particular, we need to have the set point.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.790
And let's say that it is 200.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.210
We have the proportional, integral, and derivative
gains.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.579
These are equal to 2.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.730
And then we have the sampling rate, given
that this is a discrete time controller, which

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.769
is equal to 1 second.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.320
And let's say that we have the first 3 sensor
readings.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.630
x1 is equal to 205.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.539
x2 is equal to 204.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.350
And x3 is equal 198.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.400
So the question is, what is the control at time 3, u3?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.460
In order to calculate this, we need
then to apply the formula of the discrete

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460
time PID controller.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.840
This is equal to the proportional gain
multiplied by

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.170
the error at time 3, plus the integral gain
multiplied by the sampling rate Delta t,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.579
multiplied by the sum of all the errors.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.420
From time one to three.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.250
And finally we have the derivative term.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.600
The derivative gain multiplied by the error

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990
at time 3 minus
the error at time 2 divided by the sampling

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.990
rate.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.990
Delta t.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.570
Let's do the partial calculation of the error
terms.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.810
The error at time one is equal to the state
at time 1 minus the set point.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.520
This is equal to 205 - 200, which is equal to five.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.840
Similarly for e2, we have that 204 minus the
set point, 200, equal to 4.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.549
And e3 is equal to 198 minus 200.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.770
This is equal to minus 2.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.369
Now we have all these values that we can plug
in in our formula.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.790
The proportional gain is 2, the error at time
three is minus 2.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.350
The integral gain is again 2, multiplied by
Delta t which is 1.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.320
And we have the sum of all the errors, so
5 + 4 + (-2).

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.219
We have finally the derivative term: 2 multiplied
by (-2 - 4) divided by Delta T, which is equal

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.409
to 1.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.270
Making all the calculations, the control at
time 3 is equal to minus 2.
