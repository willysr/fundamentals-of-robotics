00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.500
The Rapidly exploring Random Tree, RRT, starts
from the start location, in red, and incrementally

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.770
builds the tree.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.549
New samples are drawn randomly from the configuration
space and connected to the nearest vertex.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.890
When the goal, in green, can be connected,
then a search algorithm is applied to find

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.690
the best path.
