00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.520
This is an example of A star search, over
a grid.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.290
The robot in red, needs to get to the goal
location in green.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.629
Applying the transition function over the
grid, the robot can find the reachable cells

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.369
from a given cell.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.210
Starting from the start state, A star computationally
expands the possibilities by constructing

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.130
a tree representing the different potential
paths.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.070
A star chooses the next option based on the
length of the path up to the current cell

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.490
and the estimated distance to the goal, the
heuristic.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.920
In this way, it is efficient in selecting
the promising options, eventually reaching

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.470
the goal.
