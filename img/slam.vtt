00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.270
A robot with wheel encoders and a laser sensor
doesn't know where it is in the environment

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.990
and doesn't have its map.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.390
It initializes its pose with respect to an
arbitrary global reference frame.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.540
From there, as it moves, it integrates the
laser sensor measurements into a grid map.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.890
At the same time, it corrects its pose with
the partial map of the environment.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.210
This is required because of the drift in the
wheel odometry.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.820
In the end, the robot has a map of the environment
and knows where it is through the SLAM process.
